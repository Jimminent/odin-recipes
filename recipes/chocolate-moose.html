    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A delcious meal known well for its bold boldness! This is the confection of choice for many, including parents wanting a less religious Easter-Egg Hunt, hunters looking to spice up their wall-mount collection, and even rich Canadians.</p>
    <p>I'll never forget my first chocolate moose. The smell of the rich chocolate mixed with the deep musk of moose-fur. The sound of its hooves clomping over the pine needles as it chased me through the forest. The taste of victory. The subsequent dysentery. Not a beginner recipe.</p>
    </ul>

        <li>40 gallons of melted Chocolate (preferrably milk)</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
